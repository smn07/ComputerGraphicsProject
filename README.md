The project involves a showcase of a studio apartment with various main components. The initial scene is lit by four lights, and the objects have their own BRDF and textures.
The simulation allows for first-person movement within the room, with collision detection implemented through hitboxes, preventing the user from passing through objects.
When approaching an object, it is possible to focus on it, which triggers a scene change displaying only the object on screen with specificÂ rendering.
